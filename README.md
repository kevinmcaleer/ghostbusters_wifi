# Ghost Busters Wifi Scanner
Yep this is exactly what it sounds like - I've created a Wifi Scanner using a Raspberry Pi Pico W, a small Pimoroni Display for Pico, all within
a Ghostbusters PKE meter hand-held 3d printed holder.

The two arms will raise or lower dependent on the Signal strength of the wifi
